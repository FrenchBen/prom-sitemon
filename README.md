# Prometheus for Website monitoring [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FrenchBen/prometheus_sitemon.svg)][travis]


Simple example of using prometheus to track website uptime.

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is built in a modular, "microservice" like way.

This example runs some small docker containers, using docker-compose to wire them together. First, the "real" parts of the stack:

* The **prometheus engine** itself: Manages the state of all monitorables (in this case, the list of domains we care about monitoring)
* A process called **blackbox-exporter** which prometheus polls to actually execute the health checks
* An **Alertmanager**, which handles sending and managing state for alerts.

Then there are 3 small app containers that provide a simulation framework:

* **alertlogger**: Handles webhook-based alerts from Alertmanager and logs them to a file (`data/alertlogger/alerts.log`)
* **flakyhost.com**: A web server configured to intermittently fail then come back, so we can see the down/up alerting
* **reliablehost.com**: A web server which (tries) to always be reliable

To play with this, if you want to also probe some real sites, you can edit the `config/blackbox_target.yml` file and add actual domains as well.

Then, make sure you have [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (and docker) installed and run

    >>> This builds the containers for the simulation framework
    $ docker-compose build

    >>> start all the containers. Run without the `-d` if you want to see container logs.
    $ docker-compose up -d

    >>> keep an eye on the logs coming out over the alertmanager
    $ tail -f data/alertlogger/alerts.log

Then go to http://localhost:9090/alerts in your browser to see what, if any hosts are alerting.

You can also see the other metrics that are tracked.

* Go to http://localhost:9090/graph
* Type `probe_` then another name (`probe_duration_seconds` is an interesting one to see performance over time.)

These metrics could easily be added to a Grafana dashboard, as it has excellent Prometheus support.

For production use:

* Prometheus and the blackbox exporter can be run in multiple hosts (and/or multiple data centers)
* Alert manager can be run highly availably (they communicate with each other over a mesh protocol to block duplicate alerts)
* You can run Grafana or other dashboards and see other information (like response time, etc)
* Instead of a static `config/blackbox_targets.yml`, a second container could be run to programatically fetch those lists from an external source, such as a database or external API, and update the file. (The contents are dynamically reloaded within 30 seconds as needed.)
* Other types of probes (beyond HTTP) can be configured, the blackbox_exporter is hugely versatile.
